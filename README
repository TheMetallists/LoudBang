The Loud Bang

Wanna WSPR? You've got it!
First RX/TX capable WSPR client for android.

This application allow amateur radio operators and shortwave listeners to transmit 
and receive WSPR packets by utilizing their android device's soundcard in the field.
Received packets can be autouploaded to wsprnet.org, transmitted location can
follow your GPS positions. Torch (camera flashlight) can be enabled during transmission
cycles to allow usage of small solar cell or photodiode to trigger your radio's TR circuit.


    Does the app require root permissions?
		No. Why it should?
    Can it interact with other apps?
		Not for now. Maybe some radio-related apps in future.
    How easy is it to use?
		Yery very hard if you not a HAM/SWL. One push of a (hopefuly not red) button otherwise.


=====================
WARNING: Contrary to the provocative icon, the authors of this product do not like the 
use of nuclear power for any purpose apart from peaceful energy generation/medical/scientific 
purposes.
However we shall note that even peaceful nuclear energy generaton can be VERY dangerous.


=====================
This program is redistributed under GNU GPL v3 and contains parts of other software under
open source licenses.

=====================
WARNING. Allthought this program cannot transmit substantial ammounts of electromagnetic 
waves (a.k.a. radio waves) on its own we shall inform any person who intends to connect
this software to a transmission-capable radio that in almost all countries you should 
obitain some sort of license from government to do this. Radio emissions without such a 
license or permit may result in suspicious guys with weapons knocking on your door at 6 am.

Radio receiving on the other hand is allowed in most countries without any licenses,
however even democratic countries may have surprising rules enforced, so check your
laws before using this software if you are new to this thing.

====================
PERMISSIONS:
This software uses following permissions:
- record and play audio - to receive/transmit WSPR signals
- wakelock - to more efficiently drain your battery when you forgot to turn the app off (e.g. to work continuously)
- internet - to leak your spots to wsprnet.org when you don't want to
- location - to spy (i mean to autogenerate your GRID location for beacons)

Most of this permissions are requested only when you turn features that require them in the settings, and should
not be required for app to work without that features.


===================
CRASHES & BUGZ
I wanted to release this app ASAP, so i haven't included any crash reporting system. This means that
if an app crashes on you, you have to tell me as much details as possible, so I can reproduce the crash.
I will add such a system in future, but becasue of my opinion and F-droid rules it will require you
to send the crash log via email.
If you know what is logcat, you can send crash report with backtrace for now.

CONTACT
You can write to metallists ALFA_TANGO outlook DELTA_OSCAR_TANGO com

==================
TRANSLATE
If you want to translate this app to your language, you need to
find a file called strings.xml in the project source code,
open it in any text editor that supports UTF-8 and modify it
while following XML markup language. If your language is weirder than
mine, you need to provide additional details on what I should do with
numerals etc. But it may take a long time to implement all this, so
it's better if you prepare a separate file that will work somehow without
modifying large portions of code.
There is NO Iphone(r)Â©(tm) version planned. I do not have any Apple inc. 
devices to code/test/debug on, I am unfamiliar with their systems.


=================
EMOTIONAL SUPPORT
We, HAMs need more skilled coders. So, if you want to say thanks with a coin, go and 
pay someone who will create and release a new cool opensource app like this one. 
(I mean REALLY cool, not another logbook).
If you still want to donate, you have to do this in Bitcoin, 
since I prefer to remain anonymity:
